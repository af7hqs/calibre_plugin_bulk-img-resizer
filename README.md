# Calibre Editor Plugin - Bulk Image Resizer


The plugin boasts an aggressive size reduction feature, 
which in rare cases can achieve reductions by a factor of 8. 

Adjustments are made discriminately, optimizing larger images while maintaining the integrity of smaller ones,
as the conversion process is exclusively applied to images surpassing the predefined maximum resolution threshold on their shorter side.

**Key features include:**

 - Effortless image resizing
 - Optional adjustment of image quality
 - Optional format conversion

(Note: WebP images may not display correctly on all tested handheld devices, including Kindle Paperwhite IV)

**Consider TODO:**

 - selective picker for compression
 - better diffing when changing formats
 - github actions for
   - adding zip to releases on new tag
   - linting project on commit
