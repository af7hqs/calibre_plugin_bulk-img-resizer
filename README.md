# Calibre Editor Plugin - Bulk Image Resizer


The plugin boasts an aggressive size reduction feature, 
which in rare cases can achieve reductions by a factor of 8. 
While powerful, this functionality requires careful consideration as it applies to all big images, 
potentially vastly impacting their quality and appearance.


Key features include:

 - Effortless image resizing
 - Optional adjustment of image quality
 - Optional conversion to WebP format (Note: this WebP may not display correctly on some devices - including Kindle Paperwhite IV)


Adjustments are made discriminately, 
optimizing larger images while maintaining the integrity of smaller ones, 
as the conversion process is exclusively applied to images surpassing the predefined maximum resolution threshold on their shorter side.
